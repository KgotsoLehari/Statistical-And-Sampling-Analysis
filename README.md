**Project Summary**

Assignment 2 focuses on sampling methods using Python, including Monte Carlo simulations, the Bootstrap method, and the acceptance-rejection method. The assignment consists of seven questions, each requiring different approaches and techniques. For each question, the number of Monte Carlo replications is set to $M = 10000$ and the number of Bootstrap replications is set to $B = 1000$. The seed for the simulations is set to numpy.random.seed(12345).

**ETL Process**

The ETL process for this assignment involves extracting the necessary data or parameters for each question, applying the sampling methods as required by the question, and analyzing the results.

**Skills Developed**

-Advanced Python programming skills

-Sampling methods such as Monte Carlo simulations, Bootstrap method, and acceptance-rejection method

-Statistical analysis and inference

-Data visualization and interpretation

**Conclusion**

 This assignment provides a comprehensive overview of sampling techniques and their importance in statistical modeling and decision-making.
